# keyboard_classification_cnn

Source dataset: http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech101/

Uses Convolutional Neural Network for image recognition. In this case it is to classify different keyboard instruments. 

The activation function uses rectifier function as it is commonly used in deep neural networks like CNN and dataset is non-linear. Currently the network uses 10 epochs for short training but sufficient for good image classification.
